# InstaQueue App ‚è±Ô∏è

![InstaQueue](https://github.com/gerardormz98/insta-queue-ui/assets/20232727/d85d36d3-db1c-4cd5-bba4-dd6d536fa37b)

InstaQueue is a real-time waitlist manager for restaurants and businesses. Users can join the waitlist, see their position in real-time, get notified when their table is ready, and more!

Inspired by Yelp's waitlist. Built by me üòä.

## Features

## Try it live!
You can test the project here: https://instaqueue.netlify.app/

## Technology stack
This app was built in Angular 17 + .NET in the back-end. It uses Microsoft SignalR to achieve real-time functionalities, and a regular REST API for the other stuff.

Back-end source: https://github.com/gerardormz98/insta-queue-server.

Here's the details of the technologies used:

 - `Angular 17`
 - `.NET 7`
 - `Microsoft SignalR`
 - `Entity Framework Core`
 - `Json Web Token`
 - `Tailwind CSS`
 - `Microsoft Azure`
 - `Netlify`

## Note 
This is a practice project I built in my free time to challenge my development skills. It is not intended to be used in a production environment (yet) and all the data captured will be removed eventually.

Feel free to test it and report any bugs you find. Suggestions or comments are also welcome!

Thank you!
